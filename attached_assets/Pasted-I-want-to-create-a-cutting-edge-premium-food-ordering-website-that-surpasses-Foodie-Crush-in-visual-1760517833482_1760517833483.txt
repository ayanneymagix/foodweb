I want to create a cutting-edge, premium food-ordering website that surpasses Foodie Crush in visual richness, interactivity, user experience, and functionality, especially tuned for a North Indian restaurant specializing in Paneer Butter Masala, Dal Makhani, Butter Naan, etc. The style should draw inspiration from iman-gadzhi.com for animations and polish. The site must include all modern features: address management, rewards, coupons, smooth animations, etc.

1. 🧱 Pages & Structure Enhancements

Home Page
  • Big hero section with high-quality hero image/video of dishes, slow-motion steam or spices, layered parallax background.
  • Auto scroll reveals: tagline, “order now”, chef specials carousel with animated transitions.
  • Prominent promotions/offers section (“Spicy Festival”, “Combo Deals”) with interactive cards.

Menu / Explore Page
  • Categorized sections (Starters, Main Course, Breads, Desserts, Beverages) with filters by veg/non-veg, price, popularity.
  • Dish cards that animate in on scroll (fade + slide + maybe slight scale).
  • Hover effects on dish images (zoom, shadow, overlay with “Add to Cart”).

Cart & Checkout Flow
  • Persistent cart drawer or sidebar that updates live.
  • Ability to apply coupon codes / redeem reward points during checkout.
  • Address page: users can save multiple addresses (home, work, etc.), upload address proof image (optional), edit/delete addresses.

Rewards & Coupons Section
  • Page/tab where users can see their reward points, history of rewards earned.
  • List of active coupons/promos with descriptions, expirations, and “Apply” or “Copy” buttons.
  • Mechanism to redeem reward points for discounts or freebies.

User Profile / Dashboard
  • Personal info, saved addresses, order history.
  • Order tracking: show status (Received → Preparing → Out for Delivery → Delivered), timeline bar, estimated time.

About / Contact Pages
  • About Us: story of the restaurant, chef photos, philosophy, possibly video or animated background.
  • Contact: contact form, map embed, social links, phone & email, business hours.

Login / Signup
  • Smooth overlay modal or dedicated page.
  • Options: email/password + social login (Google etc.).

Admin Panel (Optional but desirable)
  • Manage dishes (add/edit/delete) with images, pricing, categories.
  • View orders, update order statuses, manage coupons, view user data and reward history.

2. 🎨 Design & Animation Upgrades

Use high-impact animations:
  • Page transition animations (fade, slide) between major sections/pages.
  • Reveal-on-scroll (fade + slide + scale) for headings, dish cards, section backgrounds.
  • Parallax effects: background layers, hero image, sections moving at different speeds.
  • Micro-interactions: button hover, image hover, interactive icons.
  • Floating / particle / smoke / spice elements in background (very subtle).
  • Depth / 3D layering where possible (e.g. cards in front of backgrounds).

Color & Typography
  • Warm, rich palette reflecting North Indian food: gold / maroon / deep red / cream / green.
  • Premium font choices: elegant serif for headings, clean sans serif for body.
  • High-quality images of food.

Responsiveness & Performance
  • Ensure mobile version is smooth with animations optimized or simpler.
  • Lazy loading images.
  • Smooth scroll, minimal layout shift.

3. ⚙️ Functional Improvements

Real-time Cart updates and persistent cart (saved between sessions).

Address management & upload: multiple addresses, optional address proof upload.

Order tracking with a visible timeline.

Option to schedule orders (e.g. for later).

4. 📦 Tech Stack / Implementation Recommendations

Frontend: React.js / Next.js

Styling: Tailwind CSS (+ custom CSS where needed)

Animations: Framer Motion / GSAP / ScrollTrigger / Locomotive Scroll

Backend: Node.js + Express or Firebase / Supabase

Database: MongoDB, Firestore or SQL depending on scale.

Authentication: Email/password + external (Google).

Payment: Integrate a payment gateway (Razorpay / Stripe) if needed.

Hosting: Vercel, Netlify, or a platform with good performance.

5. 🗣 Tone & User Experience

The site should feel premium, immersive, mouth-watering. Users should get excited just by looking around.

Animations should feel smooth, not gimmicky. Every animation should have purpose (enhancing usability or delight).

Clear user journey: browsing → selecting → applying coupons / rewards → checkout should be frictionless.

Trust-building: high-quality photos, clean design, visible contact info, delivery time estimates.
